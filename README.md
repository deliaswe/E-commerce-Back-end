## Description

- This application is designed to streamline e-commerce businesses by providing an integrated MySQL database and utilizing Sequelize as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. 
- With Sequelize, code readability and reusability are enhanced, making it easier to manage the database efficiently. Instead of relying on a user interface, users can interact with the database through API routes, simplifying the overall process.
